To install word macro and make shortcut follow the instructions here. First open word and hit alt+f8. Then create a new macro and copy paste the code below into it. To create a keyboard shortcut follow the instructions on this website according to your word version. http://www.gmayor.com/installing_macro.htm
I suggest adding the shortkey ctrl+shift+alt+r 
The macro currently formats the tables, centers the images, and deltes the [H]. It would be nice to automatically add the date under the author since this does not carry over from latex.



Sub reportRx()

  Application.ScreenUpdating = True
    Dim tbl As Table
    For Each tbl In ActiveDocument.Tables
        tbl.Style = "Colorful List - Accent 3"
        tbl.ApplyStyleFirstColumn = False
       tbl.Rows.Alignment = wdAlignRowCenter
    
    Next
    
  
      Dim shpIn As InlineShape, shp As Shape
  For Each shpIn In ActiveDocument.InlineShapes
    shpIn.Select
    Selection.ParagraphFormat.Alignment = wdAlignParagraphCenter
  Next shpIn
  For Each shp In ActiveDocument.Shapes
    shp.Select
    Selection.ParagraphFormat.Alignment = wdAlignParagraphCenter
  Next shp
  
  With Selection
.HomeKey wdStory
With .Find
.ClearFormatting
.Replacement.ClearFormatting
While .Execute(findText:="[H]", _
MatchWholeWord:=True)
Selection.Range.Paragraphs(1).Range.Delete
Wend
End With
End With

End Sub
