To install word macro and make shortcut follow the instructions here. First open word and hit alt+f8. Then create a new macro and copy paste the code below into it. To create a keyboard shortcut follow the instructions on this website according to your word version. http://www.gmayor.com/installing_macro.htm
I suggest adding the shortkey ctrl+shift+alt+r 
The macro currently formats the tables, centers the images, and deltes the [H]. It would be nice to automatically add the date under the author since this does not carry over from latex.
